# Runtime

<primary-label ref="runtime"/>

Code that runs during runtime is the backbone of all projects. Without runtime commands, there would be nothing
happening in-game. You can think of everything under the 'runtime' category as things that happen in the game and can't
be determined before being run.

Runtime is a **massive** category, so it may be useful to choose a topic you're interested in learning about before
attempting to tackle the entire runtime documentation:

- [Values, scoreboard objectives with types and extra features](Values.md)
- [Functions with return types, parameters, async, etc.](Functions.md)
- [Compiler-defined functions](Built-In-Functions.md)
- [Logic and comparison](Comparison.md)
- [Loops and repeating code](Loops.md)
- [Attributes that can be applied to values and functions](Attributes.md)
- [Indexing and 'clarifying' values](Indexing.md)
- [Text commands and text formatting](Text-Commands.md)

## Niche Stuff
There are also articles on the [more complex commands in MCCompiled](Commands-Deep-Dives.md), as well as rich
features [which are built for the creation of addons.](Add-On-Features.md)

Ultimately, whatever you decide to touch first is up to you. MCCompiled is massive but worth learning about every little
feature available.
