# Getting Started

Learning a new tool always takes time, but this guide should help you get up and running with MCCompiled as soon as
possible so that you can win back time through using it.

- If you are looking to make this as easy as possible: [Installation](Installation.md).
- If you want more control over the installation process: [Manual Installation](Manual-Installation.md)
- If you want to integrate MCCompiled into your <tooltip term="regolith">[Regolith](%regolith_url%)</term> projects: [Regolith Installation](Regolith-Installation.md)

## Choice of Editor
> [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Fleet](https://www.jetbrains.com/fleet/) support are planned for the near future.
{style="note"}

There are three primary ways of compiling/running MCCompiled code.
1. Through the official <tooltip term="editor">[editor](%editor_url%)</tooltip>, the recommended choice for most users as of now.
2. Through the command line, which offers more granular control over compilation and output.
3. Through <tooltip term="regolith">[Regolith](%regolith_url%)</term>, integrated with other various tools.

All of these options have their uses, so it's up to you to decide which fits you best. If you're learning/evaluating
MCCompiled, the web editor is the best choice since it's zero effort to get started, *and* you get to enjoy all the
language features out of the box without any setup.

Developers may choose to do a hybrid of the editor and manual compilation via things like build scripts.
See [here](Compiling-Manually.md) on how to compile code manually through the command line.

Additionally, developers can choose to use the officially supported Regolith filter to use MCCompiled features
alongside other community-developed plugins. See [here](Regolith-Installation.md) on how to set it up for a project.

### What this Guide Will Use
Examples, language, etc. across this documentation will use the official <tooltip term="editor">[editor](%editor_url%)</tooltip> to keep everything as clear and easy
as possible.
