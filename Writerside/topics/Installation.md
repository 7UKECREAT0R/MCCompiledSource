# Installation

Let's get started by installing MCCompiled using the installer. The installer can perform installation, uninstallation,
and updates with a single click.

See [Manual Installation](Manual-Installation.md) if you prefer not to download the installer.

## Download
Download the latest installer release [here](https://github.com/7UKECREAT0R/MCCompiled/blob/main/mc-compiled-installer.zip)
and unzip the files into the directory of your choice.

## Running
If MCCompiled is detected to already be installed on your system (looking for `mc-compiled` in the PATH variable), its
version will show up, and you will be given the option to uninstall or update. If MCCompiled is not installed, you will
be able to install it.

If MCCompiled is not yet installed, you will have a single "INSTALL" button. MCCompiled %latest_version% will be installed
into the current user's LocalAppData folder *(or if updating, the original location)*.

## Testing
Open a command line window and run `mc-compiled --version` to make sure it's properly installed. If not, make sure to
restart all instances of the terminal and/or restart your computer.

## First Project
It's time to get your first project up and running. See [here](Hello-World.md) on how to begin.
