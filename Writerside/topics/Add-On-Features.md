# Add-On Features

<primary-label ref="runtime"/>

Some features in MCCompiled touch the area of addons. While sparse, they aim to add coverage to areas of addon development
that lie very closely with commands, such that it's more convenient to have it built into the language.

The features shown in this subtopic are integrated with everything else in MCCompiled, despite being somewhat further
away from commands.
