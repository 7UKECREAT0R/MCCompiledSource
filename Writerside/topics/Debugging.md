# Debugging

Debugging with logging, assertions, errors, and halting code in MCCompiled to prevent bugs and issues.
</link-summary>

Sometimes, when working on a project, things don't work as you expect. You may also wish to add guards which make sure
that the project can only be compiled if certain things *are* working as you expect.

MCCompiled has two commands made for debugging and guarding against bugs.

## Logging
The `$log` command accepts *any inputs of any amount*. It will print the input tokens to the console when compiled, separated
by spaces. The log command works just as well with a single string specified, too.

Logging is useful to get context about what's happening to preprocessor variable(s) at a certain place in the code.
When something unexpected is happening, logging is the first step to figuring out why.
```%lang%
$var numbers 4 6 8
$add numbers 10

$log $numbers
```

## Assertions
> This section talks about assertions at __compile time__. [See here for information about testing and/or asserting at
> __runtime__.](Testing.md)
> {style="note"}

When you make an assumption about what a preprocessor variable will contain in your code, you can reinforce that
assumption using assertions. The `$assert` command takes a [compile-time condition, the same as the `$if` command](Comparison-compile-time.md#comparison),
with the addition of an optional 'message' parameter.

If the condition doesn't evaluate to true, an error is thrown by the command and your project *won't compile*.

Using assertions is particularly useful in places where it's vital for code not to break if you make a change.
Code can break for many reasons, but it's almost always unintentional as a side effect of some other change. Assertions
let you catch it before it reaches runtime.

```%lang%
$var numbers 4 6 8
$add numbers 10

$assert numbers == 14 16 18
```
Based on the code, you would expect the results to be `14, 16, 18`, so an assertion is made to reinforce that.
Uses of `$assert` in real code would likely be a little different; restricting numbers to certain bounds, making sure
that strings aren't too long, etc...

### Larger Assertion Example {id="larger_example"}
The following example shows a snippet of code which makes sure that the input doesn't move the player downwards under
any circumstance. By creating this assertion, you guarantee that the player canâ€™t be moved down using this macro.

<snippet id="macro_1">
```%lang%
$macro movePlayer x y z {
    $assert y >= 0
    tp @s (~ + $x) (~ + $y) (~ + $z)
}
```
</snippet>

### Using Custom Messages {id="custom_assertion_message"}
You can provide a custom message as a [string literal](Syntax.md#strings) at the end of your assertion. If present,
it will be what shows up in the compiler error, rather than the generic "assertion failed, ..."
```%lang%
$macro movePlayer x y z {
    $assert y >= 0 "Height must be above 0."
    tp @s (~ + $x) (~ + $y) (~ + $z)
}
```

## Throwing Errors
Throwing an error can be useful when something goes terribly wrong, and you need to figure out where it happened.
This is done using the `throw` command, which runs at runtime and fully halts execution. `throw` supports
[format-strings](Text-Commands.md#format-strings).
```%lang%
throw "Player {@s} didn't have an id. ({id})"
```

## Halting Code
If you need your code to stop executing immediately, you can run the `halt` command. Doing this will generate an
infinite loop and force the "function command limit" to kick in and stop execution.
